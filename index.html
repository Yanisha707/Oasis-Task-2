          <h2>The Father of Phyics</h2>
          <p><b>Albert Einstein</b> was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany,
            on<b> March 14, 1879</b>. Six weeks later the family moved to
            Munich, where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold
            Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and Albert continued his
            education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss
            Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher
            in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his
            diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable
            to find a teaching post, he accepted a position as technical
            assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his
            doctor’s degree.
          </p>
          <p>During his stay at the Patent Office, and in his spare time,
              he produced much of his remarkable work and in 1908 he was
              appointed Privatdozent in Berne. In 1909 he became Professor
              Extraordinary at Zurich, in 1911 Professor of Theoretical
              Physics at Prague, returning to Zurich in the following year
              to fill a similar post. In 1914 he was appointed Director of
              the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the
              University of Berlin. He became a German citizen in 1914 and
              remained in Berlin until 1933 when he renounced his citizenship
              for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the
              position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton*. He
              became a United States citizen in 1940 and retired from his post
              in 1945.

              After World War II, Einstein was a leading figure in the World
              Government Movement, he was offered the Presidency of the State
              of Israel, which he declined, and he collaborated with Dr. Chaim
              Weizmann in establishing the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

          <p> With a small but steady income for the first time, Einstein felt
              confident enough to marry Maric, which he did on January 6, 1903. 
              Their children, Hans Albert and Eduard, were born in Bern in 1904
              and 1910, respectively. In hindsight, Einstein’s job at the patent 
              office was a blessing. He would quickly finish analyzing patent 
              applications, leaving him time to daydream about the vision that 
              had obsessed him since he was 16: What would happen if you raced 
              alongside a light beam? While at the polytechnic school he had 
              studied Maxwell’s equations, which describe the nature of light, 
              and discovered a fact unknown to James Clerk Maxwell himself—namely, 
              that the speed of light remains the same no matter how fast one moves. 
              This violates Newton’s laws of motion, however, because there is no 
              absolute velocity in Isaac Newton’s theory. This insight led Einstein 
              to formulate the principle of relativity: “the speed of light is a 
              constant in any inertial frame (constantly moving frame).”Explaining E = mc2
              Explaining E = mc2          
              During 1905, often called Einstein’s “miracle year,” he published four 
              papers in the Annalen der Physik, each of which would alter the course 
              of modern physics.
